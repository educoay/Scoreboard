This project is made of a single main C++ file, which will be compiled for Arduino AVR 
architecture, and control a scoreboard with 7-segments display and voltage analog input.
A real application has been developed with this library, showing the score and time in a 
basketball match for a local team. 
Documentation pdf format regarding realization and software can be found in the Doc folder.
The code is at http://display-group.googlecode.com and some pictures are at
