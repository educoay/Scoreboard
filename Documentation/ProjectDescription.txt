Hello, my project is a scoreboard for basketball/volleyball games, made with Arduino UNO and big even segments display. 
I realized everything by hand, from the wood structure to the electrical wirings, to the Arduino control program, which supports the C++ Standard library for AVR MCUs.
A C++ library is used to dynamically configure the displays, with display grouping and value padding. Display with different segments code can live on the same data bus, with an easy configuration.
The scoreboard has been used for more than 2 year by "real users", in real basketball championship! It is controlled by a small panel, which was wired to the board, but recently I had to implement wireless communication with Xbee, because of different rules in the new championship the team is going to play in this year!
Even volleyball mode is supported, with change of the scoreboard mode on the fly, without losing the actual score.
This score is automatically retained in EEPROM memory and can be restored with a button press, in case of power loss.
Even a real car horn is mounted to signal the end of the period!! :) 
On the Google code site you can find link to the software and hardware documentation (in the svn repo), data sheets, pictures, drafts, Xbee configurations... etc..   
Thank you for this opportunity to get visibility for my project!
